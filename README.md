# schwab-account-blurring
This is a web extension to blur account numbers when navigating around Schwab.com. It is by no means meant to be a complete implementation and is rather naive in its implementation. Performance could be greatly improved if a page-by-page approach was taken. This meets my needs. Intended for use in firefox.
